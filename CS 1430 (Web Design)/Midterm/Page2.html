    <p> The aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis) is a lemur, a strepsirrhine primate native to Madagascar that combines rodent-like
        teeth that perpetually grow and a special thin middle finger.</p>

    <div class="div-2">
    <p> It is the world's largest nocturnal primate, and is characterized by its unusual method of finding food: it taps on trees to
        find grubs, then gnaws holes in the wood using its forward slanting incisors to create a small hole in which it inserts its
        narrow middle finger to pull the grubs out. This foraging method is called percussive foraging, and takes up 5â€“41% of foraging time.</p>

    <div class="div-3">
    <p> The only other animal species known to find food in this way is the striped possum. From an ecological point of view, the aye-aye
        fills the niche of a woodpecker, as it is capable of penetrating wood to extract the invertebrates within.The aye-aye is the only
        extant member of the genus Daubentonia and family Daubentoniidae. It is currently classified as Endangered by the IUCN; and a second
        species, Daubentonia robusta, appears to have become extinct at some point within the last 1000 years.</p>
