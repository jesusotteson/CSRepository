    <h1> About </h1>
      <p> Take a 2,500-pound pizza oven, 14 beer taps, one cask-conditioned ale and what do you get?</p>
      <h2>You get Pizza Co.</h2>
      <p> This restauraunt started by Johnathon Martin (Formaly Precious) was one of the many risks he took</p>
      <p>in his journey out of the farm.</p>
      <p>“One day I woke up and realized that there has to be more to life than just eating grass and living</p>
      <p>the farm,” said Martin, "I didn't just want to be a family pet, wasting my time, I wanted more in</p>
      <p>life, I wanted to own my own restaurant." It was at this point Johnathon retired from being the</p>
      <p>family goat, and became the first goat to own a business.
