			<p>Europe is a Swedish rock band formed in Upplands Väsby in 1979,[5] by vocalist Joey Tempest, guitarist John Norum, bass guitarist Peter Olsson, and drummer Tony Reno.</p>
			<p>They got a major breakthrough in Sweden in 1982 by winning the televised competition "Rock-SM" (Swedish Rock Championships) It was the first time this competition was held, and Europe became a larger success than the competition itself.</p>
			<p>Since their formation Europe has released eleven studio albums, three live albums, three compilations and nineteen music videos. Europe rose to international fame in the 1980s with their third album, 1986's The Final Countdown, which has sold over 3 million copies in the United States and 15 million copies worldwide (including album and single). Europe have sold over 25 million records worldwide.</p>
